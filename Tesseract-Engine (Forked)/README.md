# 3D Tesseract-Engine

This is a 3D Engine created by [Adrià Ferrer](https://github.com/Adria-F) and [Marc Garcia](https://github.com/MaxitoSama) students of the
 [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/).

##  Controls:

* Right click to rotate the camera arround itself.
* Right click + “WASD” to move the camera.
* Alt + left click to rotate the camera arround an object.
* Mouse wheel to zoom in/out.
* Mouse wheel click to move the camera across camera local Y and X axis.
* F to focus the camera around the geometry.
* SHIFT + Movement to duplicate the movement speed.
* CTRL + Movement to reducethe movement speed.
* N to recalculate QuadTree
* M to erase QuadTree

## Extra instructions

* Drag and drop of .FBX/.fbx/.png/.dds to import into assets
* Double click assets on Assets panel to add them to the scene
* Right click on an item of asset panel or game object in hierarchy to delete
* Drag an item from assets panel into a folder to move item
* Drag an item from assets panel into the link at the top of the panel to move to the previous folder
* Drag game objects through hierarchy to change parents
* Select a game object to see its components on inspector
* In inspector you can click the '+' symbol at the end of each component tab to see more options
* In inspector you can add empty components of type "mesh" or "texture"
* Click the sphere next to the gray box to change the assigned asset to each component

## Innovation:

* We are using a frame buffer to draw all the scene on a gl texture, which we then draw into an ImGui window.
This texture, accepts windows resizing without deforming.

* We designed our own File System using PHYSFS.

* We designed a JSON_manager to easily work with JSON files using rapidjson library.

* We have a panel Assets that show everything in Assets folder (except .meta files) were you can move or remove any asset and add/remove folders.

* Can freely change the color that a mesh is using from the panel inspector.

* Can change the resource assigned to a component from a list of all the resources of that type.

* We have a panel file dialog that allows to open a directory and navigate through its folders, (you can define an exclusive extension to search or ignore).

## Libraries

* STL to use the basic containers.
* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) to create the window and imputs.
* [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to create the UI.
* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) to create the renderer, 3D shapes, buffers and textures.
* [rapidjson](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson) to read and write JSON files.
* [PCG](http://www.pcg-random.org/download.html) to create random numbers.
* [MathGeolib](https://github.com/juj/MathGeoLib) to make all the math operations.
* [Assimp](http://www.assimp.org/) to import .FBX/.fbx of 3D models.
* [DevIL](http://openil.sourceforge.net/) to import the .png and .dds to create te textures.
* [mmgr](http://www.flipcode.com/archives/Presenting_A_Memory_Manager.shtml) to manage the memory used.
* [PHYSFS](https://icculus.org/physfs/) to manage files.
* [ImGuizmo](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo) Immediate mode 3D gizmo for scene editing and other controls based on Dear Imgui
